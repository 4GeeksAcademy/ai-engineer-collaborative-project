## 🎯 Your challenge

You are working on a small development team at a consulting firm, and a new project has just landed: **a well-known French clothing brand** wants a **visual and functional prototype** for their upcoming online store.

The client has been clear about the requirements:

- **Solid SEO** (semantic structure, indexable content, best practices).
- **Modern**, consistent design.
- **Fully responsive**: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Before moving to full development, they need to see a prototype that includes **at least 5 main views**:

1. **Home**
2. **Catalog**
3. **Product view**
4. **Cart**
5. **Payment form (checkout)**

Time to shine. The consulting firm put together a team for the project and assigned you and one other person to get it done.

Your _project manager_ has shared a document with the minimum structure for each view to avoid oversights and ensure the prototype meets the client’s expectations.

### Specifications by view

#### 1) Home page

- **Top bar (navbar)** with:
  - Logo
  - Search bar
  - User account menu
- **Hero section** highlighting special products or brand campaigns.
- Two sections with horizontal product lists (_cards_):
  - **New arrivals**
  - **Best sellers**
- **Footer** with sections:
  - **Categories:** footwear, shirts, pants, accessories
  - **Legal:** terms and conditions, privacy policy, about the brand
  - **Contact**
- **The navbar and footer are reused** across all other views.

#### 2) Catalog

- Keeps **navbar and footer**.
- Includes a **filter bar** before the list:
  - Filter by **category**
  - Filter by **size**
- Product list in a **4×5 grid** (20 products visible as reference).

#### 3) Product view

- Two-column layout:
  - **Left:** product image taking roughly **half the width**.
  - **Right:** main product information:
    - Name
    - Code or reference
    - Size
    - Price
    - Quantity selector
    - **"Add to cart"** button
- Below, a **detailed description** section:
  - Materials
  - Recommended use / scenarios for wearing the item

#### 4) Cart

- Full cart view (not a side panel).
- List of added products with:
  - Thumbnail
  - Unit price
  - Quantity
  - Total per product
- Summary box with:
  - Subtotal
  - Tax
  - Total
  - **"Purchase"** button
- Add **3 sample products** to show the visual behavior.

#### 5) Payment form (Checkout)

Flow in **3 steps**:

1. **Personal details**
2. **Shipping address**
3. **Card payment** (card details)

Now it’s time to build a clear, consistent, and responsive prototype that shows the store’s potential and makes it easy for the client to approve. **Let’s get to it!** 😁

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** In this project we will only use **HTML and Tailwind CSS**. Make sure your AI Copilot **does not include more advanced technologies** (e.g., React). State this from the beginning.

## 💻 What you need to do

You must develop an e-commerce _website_ in collaboration with your teammate, using good practices in both development and project management with Git.

Apply everything you’ve learned so far: **semantic HTML**, **Tailwind**, **Schema.org**, responsive design, **Git**…

Use AI to work more efficiently, but step by step and with quality.

You only need to build the views mentioned above and connect them:

- [ ] **Home** — navigation bar, Hero, new products list, best-selling products list, footer
- [ ] **Catalog** — product list and filter bar
- [ ] **Product view** — image, details, price and description
- [ ] **Cart** — full view of cart content with products, totals and purchase button
- [ ] **Payment form** — personal details, shipping address and card details

**Regarding change management:**

- [ ] Work with _branches_ for each view (they will make deliveries easier).
- [ ] Submit each branch via a _pull request_ (PR) to merge it into the main branch.
- [ ] Update your branch before submitting to avoid errors and conflicts.
- [ ] If there are conflicts, work with your team to resolve them together.
- It’s a good idea to ask the AI to make a _commit_ on the branch whenever you add something that’s already working.

## ✅ What we will evaluate

Application of everything learned so far:

- [ ] **Proper use of semantic HTML**
- [ ] **Proper use of Tailwind CSS**
- [ ] **Correct layout and grouping of visual components**
- [ ] **Application of responsive design**
- [ ] **Use of Schema.org**
- [ ] **Proper use of Git**

The submitted project must have **at least 5 HTML documents** (one per view) and its stylesheet, if applicable.

## 🌱 How to start the project

Open the template repository using a provisioning tool such as [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or clone it locally:

```bash
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello
```

Follow the steps in [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-coding-project).

💡 **Important:** Create a new repository on GitHub for your code, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your-new-url>`) and push your changes with `add`, `commit` and `push`.
